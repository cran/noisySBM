Description: Variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to fit the noisy stochastic block model to an observed dense graph 
    and to perform a node clustering. Moreover, a graph inference procedure to recover the underlying 
    binary graph. This procedure comes with a control of the false discovery rate. The method is described
    in the article "Powerful graph inference with false discovery rate control" by T. Rebafka, 
    E. Roquain, F. Villers (2020) <arXiv:1907.10176>.
